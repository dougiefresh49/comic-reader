## Review & Corrections

| Feature | Status | Spec | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Review UI — Phase A (annotation) | `done` | [review-ui-phase-a.md](review-ui-phase-a.md) | Desktop sidebar editor — edit bubbles, adjust bounds, add/delete, export fixes.json |
| Review UI — Keyboard, Speaker UX & Sort | `done` | [review-ui-keyboard-and-sort.md](review-ui-keyboard-and-sort.md) | `a` to add, Tab bubble nav, speaker auto-focus, form tab order, drag-to-reorder, character list caching fix |
| Review UI — Phase B (live regen) | `blocked` | [review-ui-phase-b.md](review-ui-phase-b.md) | In-browser re-run Gemini / re-generate audio. Needs storage migration first. |

## Pipeline & Ingestion

| Feature | Status | Spec | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Pipeline orchestrator with checkpoints | `done` | — | `scripts/ingest.ts` — Phase 2 |
| Automated image ingestion (Stagehand) | `done` | — | `scripts/scrape-pages.ts` — Phase 3 |
| Voice clip sourcing assistant | `done` | — | `scripts/find-voice-sources.ts` — Phase 4, uses GEMINI_HIGH |
| Global character registry | `done` | [character-registry.md](character-registry.md) | `data/character-registry.json` + `scripts/manage-registry.ts`. Migrated 29 characters from tmnt-mmpr-iii. |
| Book-aware context | `done` | [book-aware-context.md](book-aware-context.md) | `book-config.json` (franchise context + wiki URLs) + `character-roster.json` (cross-page/issue name consistency) + character classification (named vs generic) to skip research for background characters. |
| Interactive alias review | `pending` | [interactive-alias-review.md](interactive-alias-review.md) | Step 8.5 — per-character guided menu [1] New / [2] Alias to existing list. Prunes stale characters against bubbles.json first. Needs UX update from free-text to guided menu. |
| Review speakers (terminal) | `done` | [review-speakers.md](review-speakers.md) | Step 4.5 post-get-context — review/correct all speaker names in bubbles.json before any processing. [1] Accept / [2] Edit / [3] Choose from confirmed+registry list. Auto-accepts known registry characters. Fixes names at the source so alias-map stays clean. |
| Review speakers (browser UI) | `pending` | [review-speakers-browser.md](review-speakers-browser.md) | Browser version of step 4.5. Pipeline pauses, user reviews in `/admin/.../review/speakers`. Inline alias creation replaces step 8.5 for common case. Requires Phase B (`speaker_reviews` table). |
| Source page upload + admin dashboard | `pending` | [upload-and-pipeline-trigger.md](upload-and-pipeline-trigger.md) | `upload-source-pages` script + `/admin/new-issue` drag-and-drop page. Moves raw JPEGs to `comic-pages-raw` bucket. `/admin` dashboard shows pipeline status per issue. Requires Phase A+B. |
| Casting browser UI | `pending` | [casting-browser.md](casting-browser.md) | Browser flow for steps 9–10: Gemini suggestions as cards, yt-dlp clip download server-side, ElevenLabs PVC/Voice Design creation with status polling. Replaces terminal `find-voice-sources` + `generate-voice-models` human pause. Requires Phase A+B + `casting_tasks` table. |

## Infrastructure

| Feature | Status | Spec | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Data hosting migration (Supabase DB + Storage) | `done` | [data-hosting/README.md](data-hosting/README.md) | Phases A–D complete: 5 Storage buckets, DB schema (14 tables), frontend reads from Supabase CDN, pipeline writes to Supabase. Unblocks Review UI Phase B. |
| Auth (Clerk or Supabase) | `pending` | — | Noted as known need, not yet specced |

## Episode Generation

Specs in `specs/features/episode-generation/`. Two output modes: motion comic (free, Ken Burns + existing audio) and full cinematic (Venice.ai image + video generation). See [00-overview.md](episode-generation/00-overview.md) for architecture, cost estimates, and CLI interface.

| Feature | Status | Spec | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Motion Comic MVP | `done` | [01-motion-comic-mvp.md](episode-generation/01-motion-comic-mvp.md) | `pnpm motion-comic` — Ken Burns + ElevenLabs audio + FFmpeg. No Venice. |
| Character Setup | `done` | [02-character-setup.md](episode-generation/02-character-setup.md) | `visualDescription` registry field + seedream reference images + series.json aesthetic lock |
| Shot Planning | `pending` | [03-shot-planning.md](episode-generation/03-shot-planning.md) | Gemini Vision per page → shot-plan.json. Last free gate before Venice spend. |
| Storyboard | `pending` | [04-storyboard.md](episode-generation/04-storyboard.md) | Venice image generation per shot (seedream + flux-2-max-edit). ~$5–15/issue. |
| Video Clips | `pending` | [05-video-clips.md](episode-generation/05-video-clips.md) | Venice video queue per panel (kling-3.0 for faces, seedance-2.0 for atmosphere). ~$15–50/issue. |
| Assembly | `pending` | [06-assembly.md](episode-generation/06-assembly.md) | FFmpeg concat + ElevenLabs audio mix + optional Venice music. |
| Review System | `pending` | [review-system.md](episode-generation/review-system.md) | Human-gated review at each phase. Static HTML galleries + terminal prompts. No AI at review time. |

## Motion Comic Plus

New default render path for episodes. Replaces the old cinematic-video
direction (kept as opt-in "Hero Shot Cinematic"). See
[motion-comic-plus/00-overview.md](motion-comic-plus/00-overview.md).

| Feature | Status | Spec | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Panel Direction (Gemini panel rects + effect/audio tags) | `pending` | [motion-comic-plus/01-panel-direction.md](motion-comic-plus/01-panel-direction.md) | Replaces `plan-shots` as default. Uses cached gemini-context. |
| Panel Reader UI (Kindle-style) | `pending` | [motion-comic-plus/02-panel-reader-ui.md](motion-comic-plus/02-panel-reader-ui.md) | Double-tap enter, swipe between panels |
| Effect Library | `pending` | [motion-comic-plus/03-effect-library.md](motion-comic-plus/03-effect-library.md) | ~20 reusable CSS/canvas/SVG effects |
| Audio Layer | `pending` | [motion-comic-plus/04-audio-layer.md](motion-comic-plus/04-audio-layer.md) | Music + SFX, Freesound→ElevenLabs fallback, cached |
| MP4 Export | `pending` | [motion-comic-plus/05-mp4-export.md](motion-comic-plus/05-mp4-export.md) | Headless Chromium screen-record (sketch only) |
| Onomatopoeia bubble re-detection | `pending` | — | User task: re-add to Roboflow now that hand-tweak + multi-class detection are mature |

## From 2026-04-30 testing-session feedback

| Feature | Status | Spec | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| Persist panel-view across page nav | `done` | — | `panelViewPreferred` in `useSettings`; reader auto-enters panel view on next page if last toggle was on. Audio not auto-resumed (browser autoplay policy). |
| Runtime panel reading-order sort | `done` | — | `src/lib/panel-reading-order.ts` row-band heuristic. `source === "manual"` panels keep their persisted order. |
| Music scenes (group panels by mood run) | `pending` | [music-scenes.md](music-scenes.md) | Fixes per-panel music restart. New `music_scenes` table + ingest consolidation step. |
| SAM3 segmentation → particle layering | `pending` | [segmentation-layering.md](segmentation-layering.md) | Foreground mask layer so particles render between bg and characters/bubbles. Side-benefit: face crops drop into the lookahead pipeline for free. |
| Reader chrome redesign (Kindle-inspired) | `pending` | [reader-chrome-redesign.md](reader-chrome-redesign.md) | Auto-hiding top bar, slimmer bottom bar, reorganized settings. UI work — needs sign-off. |

## Future / Ideas

| Idea | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Roboflow model retraining | Model has improved since initial setup — may reduce need for manual bounds corrections |
| Episode web player | `/episode/[bookId]/[issueId]` route in Next.js app — after assembly pipeline ships |
| Spring-curve panel transitions | Borrow Kindle's smoothness via CSS / Framer Motion. Small change in `PanelView.transforms.ts`. |
| Action-line position hint in effect tags | Cheap fix for effects placed in wrong corner; precursor to action-line bbox detection. See `segmentation-layering.md` §"Action lines". |
