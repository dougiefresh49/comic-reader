This is `NARRATION` or a `CAPTION`. It represents a voiceover, likely an internal monologue, a telepathic message, or a narrator.\n3.  **Context**:\n    *   **Speaker**: The previous panel has Leonardo speaking (\"We let everyone down...\"). The orange box interrupts with \"Fear not. One day the rain will stop...\". The target box continues this sentence. The color orange is typically associated with Michelangelo in TMNT, but the tone is incredibly wise, poetic, and prophetic (\"Fear not\", \"Light upon your face\"). It contrasts the surfer-dude persona, suggesting either a future version, a specific serious moment, or a different entity (like a wise mentor voice, though Splinter is usually brown/grey). Given the ambiguity and the distinct \"storyteller\" vibe overlaying the action, I will classify the speaker as \"Narrator\".\n    *   **Side**: The message is hopeful and comforting to the heroes who feel they have failed. Thus, `HERO` or `NEUTRAL` (Benevolent).\n    *   **Importance**: As the narrative voice driving the emotional beat of the page, this is `MAJOR` (functionally).\n    *   **Voice Description**: The text is poetic and reassuring (\"Fear not\", \"Clouds will recede\").

It stands in stark contrast to the violence on screen.\n    *   **Emotion**: Reassuring, hopeful, peaceful.\n4.  **Performance Cues**:\n    *   The text starts with ellipsis \"...\", indicating a continuation from the previous box.\n    *   It serves as a voiceover.\n    *   Tone should be gentle and gravitas-filled.",

The dialogue is a response to the previous panel where Donatello says, \"Maybe he'll go easy on you.\" The misunderstanding or reaction implies the villain is speaking. The subsequent bubble (\"That 'fool' would be me, floppy...\") is a retort *to* the rabbit, confirming the rabbit spoke first. The unique character list identifies him as **Warbunny**.\n2.  **Side:** Warbunny is the antagonist fighting the Turtles and Rangers, so **VILLAIN**.\n3.  **Importance:** He is a named character with significant dialogue and presence in the scene, but generally a \"monster of the week\" compared to the main cast. I will classify him as **MINOR** (named secondary character).\n4.  **Voice Description:** He is a large, muscular, barbarian-themed rabbit monster. His voice should be **deep, gravelly, booming, and arrogant**.\n5.  **Emotion:** He seems insulted or incredulous that someone would suggest going \"easy\" (even if he misunderstood the context). The close-up of his face with glowing eyes reinforces a menacing and intense emotion.\n6.  **Cues:** The text is in all caps. The context is a battle. He is reacting to a perceived slight.\n\nAnalysis of the line:\n\"EASY ON ME?\" - He is repeating what he thinks he heard with disbelief.\n\"WHAT FOOL DO YOU SPEAK OF?\" - He is demanding to know who dares speak such nonsense.",

The Rangers and Turtles are gathered.\n    *   **Speaker Trace**: The speech bubble is part of a sequence. The preceding bubble (\"BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE, ZORDON.\") has a tail pointing clearly to the character in the red sleeveless karate gi. This is Jason (the Red Ranger). In the panel immediately following this dialogue, another character explicitly says, \"JASON'S RIGHT.\" This confirms the speaker is Jason.\n    *   **Character Identity**: Jason.\n    *   **Side**: `HERO`.\n    *   **Importance**: `MAJOR`.\n    *   **Context**: Zordon is praising them for a victory. Jason is countering that praise with a grim reality check. He is explaining that while the individual teams know their individual villains, the alliance between the villains is the real problem.\n    *   **Emotion**: Serious, pragmatic, concerned, perhaps a bit stressed/exhausted given the \"exhausting\" comment later.\n\n3.  **Performance Cues**:\n    *   **Tone**: Serious, factual, slightly argumentative but respectful. He is laying out a premise for his argument.\n    *   **Volume**: Normal speaking volume, but firm.\n    *   **Cues**: [Matter-of-factly] or [Seriously].\n\n4.  **Final Polish**:\n    *   Text: \"The Turtles have dealt with Shredder for years.\"\n    *   Cue: \"[Seriously, stating a fact] The Turtles have dealt with Shredder for years.\"",

The text is likely the parting threat of the defeated villain or a message intercepted/received.\n    *   **Speaker**: The speaker is not visible. The line \"This will not be the last!\" is a classic villainous threat (vowing return/revenge). Given the cast (Rangers/Turtles), candidates are Shredder, Krang, Rita, or Zedd. Since the visual doesn't confirm the identity, I will label the speaker generically as \"Villain\" or \"Villain Voice\".\n    *   **Side**: `VILLAIN`.\n    *   **Importance**: `EXTRA` (as the specific identity is hidden/off-screen, acting as a mood setter).\n    *   **Voice Description**: Since it's a villain's threat coming through a computer console, the voice should be menacing, possibly distorted by static or electronic filtering, and loud (indicated by bold text and exclamation).\n    *   **Emotion**: Angry, vengeful, threatening.\n\n3.  **Performance Cues**:\n    *   The text is in all caps and bold with an exclamation point -> `[Shouting]`.\n    *   The context is a transmission -> `[Electronic playback]` or `[Distorted]`.\n    *   The ellipsis `...` implies the start of the clip was cut off or trailing.\n    *   The tone is heavy and serious, contrasting with the pizza eating in the background.\n\n4.  **Final Polish**:\n    *   Speaker: \"Villain\" (Not in the explicit visual list, so creating a descriptive name).\n    *   Voice: Male, deep, aggressive, filtered.",

Analyze Context:**\n*   **Context:** In the preceding dialogue, Shredder (sitting on the throne in the Moon Palace) boasts, \"I will succeed where Krang and Repulsa failed.\" Immediately after, this voice interrupts him.\n*   **Speaker:** The dialogue is a direct response to being called a failure. The setting is the \"Moon Palace\" (Rita Repulsa's base of operations). The rhetorical question \"Am I so easily forgotten?\" strongly implies the speaker is the person just mentioned: **Rita Repulsa**. Although she is not in the provided list of unique characters, this is clearly a different character entering the scene (a Major Villain).\n*   **Side:** VILLAIN.\n*   **Importance:** MAJOR (Main antagonist of the Power Rangers franchise, engaging with the main antagonist of TMNT).\n*   **Voice Description:** Rita Repulsa is known for a shrill, scratchy, and theatrical witch voice. She should sound commanding, wicked, and insulted.\n*   **Emotion:** Indignation, menace, ominousness.\n\n**3.

Studios series).\n    *   The figures present are a screaming Turtle face (extreme left), a Ranger shouting \"MASTER!\", Raphael (center, unmasked), and another Ranger saying \"OH GOD.\" (right).\n    *   The term \"Master\" is used by the Turtles to refer to Splinter. The silhouette in the top panel appears to be Splinter (holding a staff, rat-like robes) being destroyed.\n    *   Therefore, the speaker is one of the Turtles morphed into a Ranger (likely Leonardo, as he is the leader and most devoted to Splinter).\n    *   However, the visual appearance is identical to a standard Power Ranger. The prompt's \"Unique Characters\" list includes \"Red Ranger\". The instructions say: \"If the speaker in this panel looks like one of these characters, reuse the exact name.\"\n    *   The figure looks exactly like the Red Ranger (helmeted). Even though it's likely Leonardo inside, visually it falls under the \"Red Ranger\" or generic Ranger archetype. Given the strict instruction to reuse names if they look alike, and the monochromatic red coloring making color identification impossible (Leo would be Blue), I will use the provided label \"Red Ranger\" or simply treat them as a \"Red Ranger\" visual match, but the voice direction will reflect the context of a student losing a teacher.\n4.  **Context & Emotion:**\n    *   The character is witnessing their father figure/master being obliterated.\n    *   The bubble is jagged/burst, indicating a loud scream.\n    *   Emotion is pure horror, shock, and devastation.\n5.  **Cues:**\n    *   Volume: Screaming.\n    *   Tone: Heartbroken, horrified.",
