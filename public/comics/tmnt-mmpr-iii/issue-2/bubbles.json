      "aiReasoning": "The user wants me to analyze a specific text box in the provided comic page.\n\n**1. Locate & Classify:**\n*   **Target Text:** \"I'VE LITERALLY THROWN EVERY BAD GUY IN BILLY'S ARCHIVE AT HIM AND NOTHING'S SLOWED HIM DOWN.\"\n*   **Visual location:** It is inside a rectangular box with a pinkish outline, floating over the first panel (the fight scene).\n*   **Classification:** While visually it is a box (often associated with Narration/Captions), the content is clearly dialogue spoken by a character in the scene (just off-panel/voice-over). The color coding of the box borders (Gold for Zack, Pink for Kimberly) links this specific box to the character Kimberly, who speaks in the next panel with a standard speech bubble. Therefore, semantically, this is **SPEECH**.\n\n**2. Analyze Context:**\n*   **Speaker:** The box has a pink border. In the panel immediately below, the character **Kimberly** (Pink Ranger) is shown speaking, and her speech bubble has the same style. The previous caption (\"An hour. Maybe two.\") also has a pink border and a Pterodactyl coin icon (Kimberly's symbol). Thus, the speaker is **Kimberly**.\n*   **Side:** She is a Power Ranger, so **HERO**.\n*   **Importance:** She is a named main character, so **MAJOR**.\n*   **Voice Description:** Young female voice (teenager/young adult), American accent.\n*   **Emotion/Tone:** Kimberly is monitoring a combat simulation. Her tone is serious and observant. She is reporting on the situation. The text \"literally thrown every bad guy... nothing's slowed him down\" suggests she is impressed by the intensity but also concerned because she knows this is fueled by anger (referenced later as \"Angry Mikey\").\n\n**3. Performance Cues:**\n*   **Volume:** The text is standard size, not bolded or jagged. Normal volume.\n*   **Tone:** The statement is factual but carries weight. She is explaining the severity of Mikey's rampage. A tag like `[Serious]` or `[Concerned]` is appropriate.\n*   **Text Processing:** Convert from all-caps to sentence case for the script.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nType: SPEECH\nSpeaker: Kimberly\nEmotion: Serious/Concerned\nCues: [Serious]",

Context & Speaker Identification:**\n*   **Visual Analysis:** The panel shows two characters facing off.\n    *   Left: A character in a Yellow Ranger suit but with a bulky turtle shell and dagger weapons (resembling a Sai). The bubble tail points clearly to this character.\n    *   Right: The Black Ranger (holding the Power Axe). The other bubble (\"JUST TRYING TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR SHELL.\") points to him.\n*   **Narrative Context:**\n    *   In the top panels, the Green Ranger says, \"You may look like Rangers, but you don't fight like them,\" and text refers to Shredder making these enemies \"bigger and meaner.\" This indicates the Turtle-Ranger hybrids are villains/imposters created by Shredder.\n    *   In Panel 1, the real Michelangelo (Mikey) refers to himself as a \"sitting duck\" while being attacked by one of these dopplegangers.\n    *   Therefore, the Yellow Turtle-Ranger in the target panel is an enemy (Villain).\n    *   The dialogue \"Slowpoke, huh?\" is a taunt directed at the Black Ranger, likely mocking his speed or the weight of his axe.\n    *   The Black Ranger retorts with a pun about cracking his shell.\n*   **Speaker Name:** Since this is an enemy doppleganger and not one of the provided unique characters (Green Ranger, Black Ranger), I will label him \"Yellow Turtle Ranger\".\n*   **Side:** `VILLAIN`.\n*   **Importance:** `MINOR` (An enemy minion/monster, distinct from the main cast heroes).\n*   **Voice Description:** Since he is a villain mocking a hero, the voice should be arrogant, sneering, and aggressive.\n*   **Emotion:** Taunting / Mocking.\n\n**3. Performance Cues:**\n*   **Tone:** The text is a short, punchy taunt.\n*   **Cue:** `[Mockingly]` or `[Tauntingly]`.",

She is pressuring a scientist and later says \"something very special lies at the heart of this monstrosity\". Her demeanor and role suggest she is an antagonist/villain (likely a government agent or corporate villain archetype common in these crossovers).\n    *   **Importance:** She is a named character (\"Ms. Sterling\") but not one of the main titular heroes (Turtles/Rangers) or the primary legacy villains (Shredder/Rita). Thus, she fits the `MINOR` category (Named secondary character).\n    *   **Voice Description:** She is authoritative, cold, and professional. She is scolding a subordinate (Dr. Boyd). The voice should be a mature, commanding female voice, sounding impatient and stern.\n    *   **Emotion:** She is annoyed by the lack of progress (\"sounds like excuses\"). She is stating facts to pressure Dr. Boyd. Her facial expression in the close-up is hard and unamused.\n3.  **Performance Cues:**\n    *   The delivery should be sharp and accusatory.

In this comic series (and contextually on the page), blue caption boxes represent Leonardo's internal thoughts. Leonardo is the one \"going rogue\" and leaving, causing the split. The text reflects a leader's regret. So, the speaker is `Leonardo`.\n    *   **Side**: `HERO`.\n    *   **Importance**: `MAJOR`.\n    *   **Voice Description**: Since he is a major character, I don't strictly need to generate a description for an extra, but the tone should be serious, young adult male.\n    *   **Emotion**: The scene shows the team fracturing and walking away into the shadows. The line expresses regret and sadness about the outcome. The emotion is melancholic, reflective, and resigned.\n\n3.  **Performance Cues**:\n    *   The text is internal narration. It should sound like a thought.\n    *   The tone is sad and heavy-hearted.\n    *   No shouting or whispering, just a somber delivery.",
