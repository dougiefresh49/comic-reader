# Package Management Guidelines

- **MUST** use `pnpm` for all package management operations (installing, adding, removing dependencies).
- **DO NOT** use `npm` or `yarn`.
- **Ensure** `pnpm-lock.yaml` is always up-to-date and committed.
- **When adding a new dependency**, use the correct `pnpm` commands, for example:
  - `pnpm add <package-name>`
  - `pnpm add -D <dev-dependency-name>`
